I am a Big Data Developer with recent experience in data queries within python, XML, Spark, Hive, NoSQL-MongoDB, Scala, and Hadoop.
I went to school at the Art Institute of Washington-Dulles where I pursued a Bachelor's degree in Web and Graphic Design. I recently 
changed career paths to enter the technology field because I am fascinated by software development. I was first introduced to 
software development when I took an elective class called Visual Basic.

During my time with Revature, I've worked on several projects where I gained experience in back-end technologies which I listed above. 
I am very familiar with front-ended development. Those skills are HTML5/CSS3, intro to JavaScript, and J-query Library. I really enjoy
collaborating with others where we can bounce thoughts off of each other with a common goal in mind.
